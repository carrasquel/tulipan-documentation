# Properties

Tulipan.js lets you use computed properties to make any logic that requires more than one expression. This is very convenient because in order to avoid performance issues Tulipan.js limits binding expressions to only one, which could be restrictive.

## Computed Properties

With Tulipan.js we can declare computed properties. 

Let's declare this one called `myDadAge`, which is 35 by default, the age my dad was when I was born. He gets older as I do, so to calculate his current age we can use a getter function for the property `vm.myDadAge`:


JavaScript
```javascript

var vm = new Tulipan({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    myAge: 20
  },
  computed: {
    // a computed getter
    myDadAge: function () {
      // `this` points to the vm instance
      return this.myAge + 35
    }
  }
})
```

HTML
```html
<div id="app">
  I am {{ myAge }} years old, and my dad is {{ myDadAge }} years old.
</div>
```

Which will render

<div id="properties1" class="demo">
    I am {{ myAge }} years old, and my dad is {{ myDadAge }} years old.
</div>

Tulipan is aware that `vm.myDadAge` depends on `vm.myAge`, so it will update any bindings that depends on `vm.myDadAge` when `vm.myAge` changes.

## Comparing Computed Property with $watch

When you have some data that changes based on other data, one idea could be to use `$watch`, which is an API method provided by Tulipan.js that lets you observe data changes in a Tulipan instance. However, we highly recommend using computed properties instead. Consider the following example:

JavaScript
```javascript

var vm = new Tulipan({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    temperatureInCelsius: 24, 
    temperatureInFahrenheit: 75
  }
})
vm.$watch('temperatureInCelsius', function (val){
  this.temperatureInFahrenheit = val*1.8 + 32
})
```

This code is imperative and repetitive. Let's compare it with a computed property version:

JavaScript
```javascript

var vm = new Tulipan({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    temperatureInCelsius: 24, 
  },
  computed: {
    temperatureInFahrenheit: function(){
        return this.temperatureInCelsius*1.8 + 32
    }  
  }
})
```

HTML
```html
<div id="app">
  The temperature is {{ temperatureInFahrenheit }}°F.
</div>
```

Which will render

<div id="properties2" class="demo">
    The temperature is {{ temperatureInFahrenheit }}°F.
</div>

A lot better, isn't it?


## Computed Setters

Computed properties are by default getter-only, but you can also provide a setter when you need it:

JavaScript
```javascript

// ...
computed: {
  fullName: {
    // getter
    get: function () {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    },
    // setter
    set: function (newValue) {
      var names = newValue.split(' ')
      this.firstName = names[0]
      this.lastName = names[names.length - 1]
    }
  }
}
// ...
```
When `vm.fullName = ‘Daniel Smith’` is called, the setter will be called, and `vm.firstName` and `vm.lastName` will be updated accordingly. Since the get method of `fullName` depends on those, it will be recalculated.
